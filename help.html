            <h3>Getting Started with StockWatch</h3>
            <p>StockWatch is designed to help you track, analyze, and manage your stock investments. Here's how you can use each feature:</p>

            <h4>1. Adding Trades to the Trade Journal</h4>
            <p>On the <strong>Trades</strong> page, you can log your stock transactions. To add a trade, fill in the stock symbol, entry price, and other details, then click <em>Add Trade</em>. Once added, you can view all trades in a table and manage them by editing or deleting entries. You can also apply filters (symbol and date range) to narrow down the trades displayed in the table.</p>

            <h4>2. Comparing Stocks</h4>
            <p>The <strong>Compare</strong> page allows you to compare two stocks side-by-side using various metrics such as price, P/E ratio, market cap, dividend yield, and more. Enter the stock symbols and other details, then click <em>Compare</em> to see the comparison results. Use the Investment Return Calculator to estimate potential returns based on your investment amount.</p>

            <h4>3. Searching for Stocks</h4>
            <p>Use the <strong>Stock Search</strong> page to find specific stocks. Enter the stock symbol to view its key financial data, including price, market cap, and volume. You can also add stocks to your watch list from this page.</p>

            <h4>4. Managing Your Trades</h4>
            <p>In the <strong>Trades</strong> page, you can manage your trades by editing or deleting them as needed. Simply click on the <em>Edit</em> or <em>Delete</em> buttons next to the trade entry you wish to modify. You can also toggle between table view and graph view for better analysis of your trades.</p>
